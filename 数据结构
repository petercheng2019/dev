## A Bloom filter 
is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. 
False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not â€“ in other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set".
